# passwordgeneratorjavascript
made a password generator that produces a random password between 8 and 126 and displayed it in a text box.

first i pulled all the information i would need for the password generator using prompts and confirms

I added an event listener to the generate element and then made a function that creates new variables based on the imputs from above then when you click the generate button it run the other function that actually generates the password.

in my generate function i first run an if statement to make sure the length of the password is between 8 and 126 characters.
